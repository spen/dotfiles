**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

This repo exists as a quick set up for myself when using a new machine.
You're free to use or fork it but I do recommend checking out Mathias' [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) - the project that this repo is forked from.
That project will be better maintained, will likely have more sensible defaults and more detailed set up instructions.
